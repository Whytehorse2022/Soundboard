# Soundboard
This is a portfolio project which demonstrates React with bootstrap, Redux, and some hooks to useState and useEffect. Also a little font-awesome. Resize your browser to see how it adapts to different screen sizes. Try to play more than one sound at a time and notice how it pauses the playing sound before playing the subsequent sound. 

Here is a live demo: https://thesocialmale.win/soundboard/
